19. Remove Nth Node From End of List 
Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of list and return its head.

For example,

   Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

   After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
Note:
Given n will always be valid.
Try to do this in one pass.

Key point:
use two pointers, one is ahead of the other n/n-1 nodes, while one node is to the end, do the delete
define one extra root with its next as the head of given list, this convenient the design
