1, Two Sum

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].


Key point:
use a hash table
pay attention to case of 6=3+3, while their is only one 3 in the array
i.e., nums=[3, 4, 5], target =6. Notice there is no solution
