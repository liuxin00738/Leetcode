29. Divide Two Integers
Divide two integers without using multiplication, division and mod operator.

If it is overflow, return MAX_INT.

key point:
use sum and abstract to do the joint
a, 2a, 4a, 8a, 16a, basically a binary search.
map has implement a binary search tree, which can search lower bound.

abs() has overflow problem.


Time complexity: k log k, where k=log(a/b)
1, create the map:
element number is k=log(a/b)
build the tree is k long k

2, do a k step search, 
k log k
