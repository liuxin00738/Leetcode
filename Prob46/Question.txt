46. Permutations  
Given a collection of distinct numbers, return all possible permutations.

For example,
[1,2,3] have the following permutations:
[
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3,2],
  [2,1,3],
  [2,3,1],
  [3,1,2],
  [3,2,1]
]

key point:
use recursive method.
obtain result for 0:k
for 0:k+1, insert the new elements at different positions (k+1 new positions).
