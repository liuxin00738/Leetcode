15. 3Sum   
Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

For example, given array S = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]

Key point:
I use hash table to realize it, with space complecity as O(n)
use two sum as a sub function.
use a unique vec to prevent repeat: only search unique element once.

Could use a left-right two-pointer method, time complexity is the same, but save space.
