42. Trapping Rain Water    
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

For example, 
Given [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1], return 6.

key point:
use dynamic programming,
keep record the hightest element from left side, and the highest element from the right side.
the minimal is the hegiht of the wall, as a result, obtain the water.
