10, could use ssh for push, this case dont need to input the password everytime
see this link for update the link
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6565357/git-push-requires-username-and-password
and this link for generating ssh key
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/


A common mistake is cloning using the default (HTTPS) instead of SSH. You can correct this by going to your repository, clicking the ssh button left to the URL field and updating the URL of your origin remote like this:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git


11, on windows, use Git bash, which will open a MINGW64 to allow you do similar things

12, to discard all local commits and pull from cloud, use
git reset --hard origin/master
git pull origin master

13, branch related commands
git branch
This command will list all branches

git branch feature1
This command will create a new branch called feature1

git checkout feature1
This command will switch to the feature1 branch

14, pull request
Before creating the pull request, check if anyone has modify the master branch, merge master to current branch

git checkout master
git pull origin master

These two commands will show if there is any updates to the master branch

git checkout feature1
git merge master

These two commands will switch back to feature1 branch, and merge master to the feaute1 branch, fix the conflict

After finish the conflict with master branch, push the branch feature1 to cloud, and create a pull request. Wait for review.
