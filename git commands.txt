1, git clone http://
This will clone everything into a folder into current folder

2, git pull http://
This will clone everything directly into current folder
or use
git pull origin master


3, git status
obtain the difference between local folder and the cloud folder

4, git add filename
add file to be tracked
git add -A
This command will add all the files into the folder

5, git commit -m "comments"
add file to local repository, with comments

6, git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
This command is used to config the email for your github account
example:
git config --global user.email "liuxin00738@gmail.com"

7, git config --global user.name "Your Name"
This command is used to config the user name of github
example
git config --global user.name "liuxin00738"

8,  git remote add origin https://github.com/liuxin00738/Leetcode
This adds a destination folder called "origin", which current folder will be pushed into

9, git push origin master
add commited file to the cloud master branch, defined by origin.

10, could use ssh for push, this case dont need to input the password everytime
see this link for update the link
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6565357/git-push-requires-username-and-password
and this link for generating ssh key
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/


A common mistake is cloning using the default (HTTPS) instead of SSH. You can correct this by going to your repository, clicking the ssh button left to the URL field and updating the URL of your origin remote like this:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git


11, on windows, use Git bash, which will open a MINGW64 to allow you do similar things

12, to discard all local commits and pull from cloud, use
git reset --hard origin/master
git pull origin master

13, to be done.
