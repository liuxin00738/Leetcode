47. Permutations II  
Given a collection of numbers that might contain duplicates, return all possible unique permutations.

For example,
[1,1,2] have the following unique permutations:
[
  [1,1,2],
  [1,2,1],
  [2,1,1]
]


Key point:
1, do a DFS search, do it recursively
2, use a vector to record if a number has been used, and which level it is on.
3, think it as  a tree: when there are repeate elements, only insert one in each level
