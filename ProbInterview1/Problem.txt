Coding interview 

Write a C++ program that for a given m by n matrix of 0's and 1's, if any element is 0, sets the entire row and column to 0 in place. 

For example, 
[0 1 1]
[1 1 1] 
change to 
[0 0 0]
[0 1 1]

Key part:
do it in place. This can be done by using two extra labels to indicate if this element is 0 because it originally is 0, or this element is set to 0 because there is one element in its row/column is 0.
