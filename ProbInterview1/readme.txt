Compile in Linux:
------------------------
1, create a folder named "problem", put the cmakefile.txt and XinTest.cpp inside the folder
2, in terminal change path to the folder, say: 
   cd /home/sean/Documents/cpp/problem
3, run cmake use the following command:
   cmake ./
4, run make using the following command:
   make

------------------------
Run the code
------------------------
Using following command to run the code:
./XinTest
 
The code has a small builtin test case. 
On the other hand, the user can input manually a test matrix by:
first input the numbers of row and column, then input each element of the matrix (separated by space).
The code will output the matrix and the flipped result.
